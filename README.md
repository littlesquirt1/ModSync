# ModSync
A lightweight mod that syncs mods between clients and servers. Currently only for Forge 1.20.1.

## Features
- Sync mods between clients and servers
- Automatically check for updates on game start
- Self-updating
- GUI with progress bar

## Usage
Just drop the jar file into your mods folder and run the game. On the first run, you will be prompted to provide the server url.

## Server
Please see the [ModSyncServer repo](https://github.com/littlesquirt1/ModSyncServer).
A running server is required to use ModSync.

## Will you port to (version)/Fabric?
If I feel like it, yes. This mod uses a lot of non-version-specific code, so I may eventually do it. Please feel free to make an issue.
